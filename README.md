## EduLearn for Android

EduLearn is a collaborative learning platform built on **offline mesh networking**. It enables secure, decentralised peer-to-peer messaging and educational content sharing over Bluetooth LE - no internet, no servers, no phone numbers required.

The app operates in two modes:
- **Chat Mode** — Encrypted P2P messaging through a Bluetooth mesh network with IRC-style commands, channels, and private messaging.
- **Educational Mode** — A teacher-student platform for distributing quizzes, documents, and educational resources entirely offline via the mesh network.

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** Hedgehog (2023.1) or newer
- **Android SDK** API level 26+
- **JDK** 17 or newer
- **Gradle** 8.13 (bundled via wrapper)

### Build & Run

```bash
# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on connected device
./gradlew installDebug

# Clean build artifacts
./gradlew clean
```

The debug APK will be generated at:
```
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Permissions Required

| Permission | Reason |
|:---|:---|
| Bluetooth | Core BLE mesh networking |
| Location | Required by Android for BLE scanning |
| Notifications | Message alerts and background updates |
| Battery Optimization | Maintain mesh connections in background |

### Hardware Requirements

- Bluetooth LE support
- 2GB RAM recommended

## Usage

### Chat Mode Commands

| Command | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `/j #channel` | Join or create a channel |
| `/m @name message` | Send a private message |
| `/w` | List online users |
| `/channels` | Show all discovered channels |
| `/block @name` | Block a peer |
| `/unblock @name` | Unblock a peer |
| `/clear` | Clear chat messages |
| `/pass [password]` | Set/change channel password (owner only) |
| `/transfer @name` | Transfer channel ownership |
| `/save` | Toggle message retention (owner only) |

### Getting Started

1. **Install the APK** on your Android device (requires Android 8.0+)
2. **Grant permissions** for Bluetooth, Location, and Notifications when prompted
3. **Optionally disable battery optimization** for reliable background mesh operation
4. **Choose a mode** — Chat Mode or Educational Mode
5. **Start chatting** — the app auto-discovers nearby peers via Bluetooth mesh
6. **Messages relay** through the mesh network across multiple hops to reach distant peers

## Technical Architecture

### Binary Protocol
EduLearn uses an efficient binary protocol optimized for Bluetooth LE:
- Compact 13-byte packet header with 1-byte type field
- TTL-based message routing (max 7 hops)
- Automatic fragmentation for large messages
- Message deduplication via unique IDs and Bloom filters

### Mesh Networking
- Each device acts as both BLE central and peripheral simultaneously
- Automatic peer discovery and connection management
- Store-and-forward for offline message delivery
- Adaptive duty cycling based on battery state
